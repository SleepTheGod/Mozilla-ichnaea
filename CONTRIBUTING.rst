How to contribute
=================

We gladly accept outside contributions.

We use
`Github issue tracker <https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea/issues>`_
for both discussions and talking about new features or bugs. For
confidential issues or security bugs, please use
`Bugzilla <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Location&component=General&bug_status=__open__>`_.
You can also fork the project and send us a pull request.

If you have a more general topic to discuss, the
`Location category
<https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/location/506>`_
is a good place to do so.


Development
===========

If you want to work on the code and sent us a
`pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_,
first fork the repository on github to your own account. Then clone
your new repository and `follow the installation instructions
<https://ichnaea.readthedocs.io/>`_.
While working on the code, the `testing instructions
<https://ichnaea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/testing.html>`_
should come in handy.


Legal
=====

Currently we don't have any legal contributor agreement, so code
ownership stays with the original authors. The project is licensed
under the
`Apache License Version 2 <https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea/blob/main/LICENSE>`_.
